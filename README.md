# Grad Trader Fitness

Overview
========
Introduction
------------
Proof of concept for fitnesse tests running against the GradTrader app.
It combines both ui tests running via webdriver and business logic tests running directly against the server code in a more junit like style.
(As the GradTrader app has no persistent data, there's no need for dedicated database mocking mechanism).

External Dependencies
---------------------
* Fitnesse
* ChromeDriver
* GradTrader (running for UI tests).

Internal Dependencies
---------------------
* Maven dependency management
* Fitnesse/Slim fixture architecture.
* Selenium/Webdriver for browser automation in UI tests.
* GradTrader (`testing-fitnesse` branch) system under test.

Running and Installing
====================
Cheatsheet
----------
* java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8070

Fitnesse
--------
* download fitnesse jars:
* http://fitnesse.org/FitNesseDownload
* java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8070
* import wiki - details to follow

For fitnesse path settings, the following is used for a maven packaged application jar.
{{{ 
!define PROJECT_ROOT {C:\dev\git}
!define PROJECT {GradTraderFitnesse}
!define APP_ROOT {${PROJECT_ROOT}\${PROJECT}}

!define ARTIFACT_ID {grad-trader-fitnesse}
!define ARTIFACT_VERSION {1.0}
!define ARTIFACT_RELEASE {SNAPSHOT}
!define JAR_NAME {${ARTIFACT_ID}-${ARTIFACT_VERSION}-${ARTIFACT_RELEASE}.jar}

!define PROJECT_JAR {${APP_ROOT}\target\${JAR_NAME}}

!path ${PROJECT_JAR}
}}}

Business Logic Tests
--------------------
You will need to checkout the `testing-fitnesse` branch of GradTrader and install to the local repository.

Deploy the jar to the classpath location that fitnessse expects.
In the section abbove, we just use the local maven target folder.
* `mvn package`

UI Tests
--------

GradTrader
----------
See the grad trader app.
* Checkout `testing` branch.
* `mvn package` to write to the expected j


Install
=======
`mvn clean install`

ChromeDriver
------------
_Needed for WebDriver._

Download chrome driver:

[https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads]

As per
[https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver] ensure:
* The chromedriver binary is in the system path, or
* The Selenium Server was started with -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=c:\path\to\your\chromedriver.exe

TODO
====
* Wiki files under source control.
* Maven jar management to be tidied.
* Improve this README!
